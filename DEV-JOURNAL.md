-- 8 Mar 2023 --

- Setting up dto for order response. Interested to see if this will solve recursion as we will be wanting to work with dto most likely anyways.
- Dto implemented and relationships currently behaving as expected.
- Next steps will include implementing tests, and reformatting database to include a column for status with a default value of open, and to be changed manually to closed after customer pays and picks up food by tons of tacos owners. May need to also include field for contact details but they will be encrypted. To be worked on at a later date.
- test sql scripts updated
- Initial Test for all orders returned successful.

---

-- 7 Mar 2023 --

- SQL scripts updated.
- Refactor implemented.
- Initial test for getting all orders and their associated values through postman successful.
- Will get a new erd up soon.

---

-- 6 Mar 2023 --

- Remove cart item tests successful.
- Create order item no longer returns the item added to cart in a response so that selected items remained cloaked. May be overkill or create other issues down the road. If so check there.

---

- Successful tests for utilizing dto to return list of order items with 200 and
  if uuid not valid returning 404.
- Created dto for returning order items with specified parameters, tests successful.
- Updating cart tests successful.
- Composite indexes may be the key to what I was originally envisioning for link between order items and order item. Will take much more research and time.

---

-- 28 Feb 2023 --

- initial order item response formatted.
- test with dto successful and good data for cart successful.

- All tests successfully functioned from returned non linked entities.
- Established succesful relationship between order items and menu items with jpa.
  Still lots of work to be done formatting the data.
- Began Implementaion of dto for order items. New tests to be written as progress made.

---

-- 23 Feb 2023 --

-- 20 Feb 2023 --

---

-- 16 Feb 2023 --

- initial logic of testing if all order item fields are valid completed.
- need to possibly redefine test order item through a builder instead of json string values.
- right now cant compare as the database is in memory and closes after writing to the db so trying to read if value is valid against the repository is mute.
- need to refine regular expressions and test again after return from break.

---

-- 9 Feb 2023 --

- Initial refactor complete. Means for adding a new order item to the database restored. Meaning that it should be feasible to create a cart. From the front end.
- Test environment scripts need to be restored however as they appear to be belly up at this point. Lots learned through the process.
- Also created new erd that represents changes. Will work on getting it up tomorrow.

---

-- 8 Feb 2023 --

- Started coming across abnormalities while conducting tests and so spent the day refactoring. Hoping the end result is for the better.

---

-- 7 Feb 2023 --

- DB refactored. Table 'order_item' is now 'cart' as this better reflects its purpose.
- Initial completion of update quantity of a cart item. Also updates the total.
- Initial completion of remove cart item. Needs some refactoring to reflect the new schema but methods were all tested and functioning in the browser and posted before changes made.
- Full crud functions for cart!

Lots to do still but starting to see light. Updated to do list.

---

-- 6 Feb 2023 --

- Refactored order item controllers and services.
- Refactored packages for organizational purposes.
- Began working out logic for updating a menu item.
- Updated documentation for menu item and order item controllers.
- Will be refactoring data structure in future. Order items will become cart items as this is more descriptive of what is actually happening.
- Order item endpoints test in browser and with postman for desired functionality. Tests will be written with JUnit following establishment of remaining endpoints for crud functionality of cart items.

---

-- 3 Feb 2023 --

- Refactored menu item controllers and created services that now provides desired functionality of shorthand or jpa search.
  -Refactored Controller naming convention .

---

-- 1 Feb 2023 --

- Built global error handler for future implementation.
- Began fleshing out functionality to be associated with adding items to a cart.
  - In summary:
    - click on item >> order uuid is generated >> relevant information is written to DB for the purpose of populating a cart for customer to alter and observe.
    - On checkout >> uuid and cart will clear after using the data in the cart to create an order and write to DB.
- Created order item controllers and repository classes.

---

-- 31 Jan 2023 --

- Test built for creating a new menu item for when that feature is implemented for the owners.
- Test built for getting menu items by category.
- Sprint concluded on target.

Tomorrow's goals

- Build error handler.

---

-- 30 Jan 2023 --

- Re-organizing menu item test for http responses.
- Organizing ideas on migrating menu item to order item.

---

-- 27 Jan 2023 --
Not as far as I wanted to get today but I'll take the small victory.

- Created test for retrieving data and comparing it against an expected set of data.
- Also tested for proper response code from the query.

---

-- 26 Jan 2023 --

- Created a configuration that works for testing in memory as well as against the actual database.
- Successfully created a test to create a new item in the database. I am not completely pleased with it however and intend to do some more work on it. Right now we create an entity to send through a constructor but I would like for the data to come from a builder instead.

Tomorrow's goals

- Try and complete means for full crud testing with in memory database.

---

-- 25 Jan 2023 --

- Revealed entity ids in order to aid in ease of working with data with method constructed in rest config
- Refined test for CRUD operations against the data base.
- Calling items by category will remain as simply a query on our menu-item endpoint.
- Considerable research into configuring H2 in memory database for testing purposes. Have possibly locked on to a configuration that will yield desired results.

Tomorrow's goals

- Try and complete means for full crud testing with in memory database.

-- 24 Jan 2023 --

Starting to get a bit more dialed with my procedure and what needs to come next. The pieces are falling together. I do find that I am prone to losing time because I worry about best practice and simply questioning if I'm doing this right in order to save work down the road. But sometimes you just gotta fool about and find out ^\_-.

- Created resources for searching menu items by id and category.
- Refined swagger document a bit more
- Created test file working with menu items by category
- Refined menu item path a bit so that a bit more precision is required to call an item and all items do not just become available upon endpoint entry.
- Updated DB with columns for descriptions and image urls.
- Added more DB entries to work with.

Tomorrow's goals

- More work on menu item category endpoint.
- Work on menu item test and error handling.
- Possibly work on logging.

---

-- 23 Jan 2023 --

- Created successful route test for a menu item.
- Created API documentation with swagger for menu-item end point.
- Added as project on github and linked to repository. Don't know how well I'll be able to keep up with project tracking while simultaneously developing application solo but going to give it a try.

Tomorrow's goals

- Create and Test menu-item endpoint for returning items by category.
- Add documentation for end point.
- Update DB to add columns 'description' and 'img-url' to menu-item table.
- Begin work on error handling.

---
