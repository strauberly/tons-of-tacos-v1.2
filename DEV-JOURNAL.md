- Revealed entity ids in order to aid in ease of working with data with method constructed in rest config
- Refined test for CRUD operations against the data base.
- Calling items by category will remain as simply a query on our menu-item endpoint.
- Considerable research into configuring H2 in memory database for testing purposes. Have possibly locked on to a configuration that will yield desired results.

Tomorrow's goals

- Try and complete means for full crud testing with in memory database.

Starting to get a bit more dialed with my procedure and what needs to come next. The pieces are falling together. I do find that I am prone to losing time because I worry about best practice and simply questioning if I'm doing this right in order to save work down the road. But sometimes you just gotta fool about and find out ^\_-.

- Created resources for searching menu items by id and category.
- Refined swagger document a bit more
- Created test file working with menu items by category
- Refined menu item path a bit so that a bit more precision is required to call an item and all items do not just become available upon endpoint entry.
- Updated DB with columns for descriptions and image urls.
- Added more DB entries to work with.

Tomorrow's goals

- More work on menu item category endpoint.
- Work on menu item test and error handling.
- Possibly work on logging.

- Created successful route test for a menu item.
- Created API documentation with swagger for menu-item end point.
- Added as project on github and linked to repository. Don't know how well I'll be able to keep up with project tracking while simultaneously developing application solo but going to give it a try.

Tomorrow's goals

- Create and Test menu-item endpoint for returning items by category.
- Add documentation for end point.
- Update DB to add columns 'description' and 'img-url' to menu-item table.
- Begin work on error handling.

- Created Menu Item repository as part of dao.
- Created Data Rest Config and limited access to read only.
- Tested endpoint in browser and with Postman.
- Created basic test classes.

Next tasks will include fleshing out the test classes. Project management with github and jira.
