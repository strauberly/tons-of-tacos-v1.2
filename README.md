# tons-of-tacos-v1.2

</div>

## This application is based off of the [tons-of-tacos](https://github.com/strauberly/tons-of-tacos) project I created earlier.

&nbsp;

## The prior application was a more simplistic command line application created to demonstrate logic solving and core Java knowledge. This version will be a fullstack application that feels as though Tons of Tacos actually exists.

&nbsp;

## Thank you for checking out what I am working on.

### I. General Design Specs

- Create a Springboot API that whose primary focus will be retrieving menu items from a MySQL database in order to create an order.
  Additional functionality at some point likely to also include:

  - Allow the food truck owners to update and edit their menu, track orders, and track sales.
  - Allow a customer to create an account where they may have access to special deals and menu items. As well as view past orders and repeat them in order to facilitate expedient orders if desired.

  &nbsp;

- Create front-end with a focus on ease of use, and reflective of owners open, kind, and hard working nature. It should emulate stopping by to have lunch with friends who have their lives together and help make their friends lives a little easier.
- Additionally the owners would like to provide their tech saavy and loyal customers with a command line application that would allow them to quickly create an order from their computer and just come down to the parking lot, pay, pick up their order and get back to work.
