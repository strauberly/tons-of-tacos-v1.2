# tons-of-tacos-v1.2

</div>

---

## This application is based off of the [tons-of-tacos](https://github.com/strauberly/tons-of-tacos) project I created earlier.

&nbsp;

## The prior application was a more simplistic command line application created to demonstrate logic solving and core Java knowledge. This version will be a fullstack application that feels as though Tons of Tacos actually exists.

&nbsp;

## Tons of Tacos is a fictional mom and pop style food truck company. This is a project designed for them and their customers in order to expedite the ordering process and increase sales.

&nbsp;

## Progress can be monitored from the [Dev-Journal](https://github.com/strauberly/tons-of-tacos-v1.2/blob/main/DEV-JOURNAL.md).

&nbsp;

## Thank you for checking out what I am working on!

### I. General Design Specs

- Focus is on getting functionality in place for customers to place orders. Then they can just come down to the truck pay in person and pick up food. After this we will implement accepting online payments and additional features.

- Create a Springboot API that whose primary focus will be retrieving menu items from a MySQL database in order to create an order.
  Additional functionality at some point likely to also include:

  - Allow the food truck owners to update and edit their menu, track orders, and track sales.
  - Allow a customer to create an account where they may have access to special deals and menu items. As well as view past orders and repeat them in order to facilitate expedient orders if desired.

  &nbsp;

- Create front-end with a focus on ease of use, and reflective of owners open, kind, and hard working nature. It should emulate stopping by to have lunch with friends who have their lives together and help make their friends lives a little easier.
- Additionally the owners would like to provide their tech savvy and loyal customers with a command line application. It would allow them to quickly create an order from their workstation and just come down to the parking lot, pay, pick up their order, and get back to work quickly.
